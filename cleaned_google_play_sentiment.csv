Facebook,Facebook needs to ban AI videos and and images. they're oversaturating the site and little to nothing is real anymore on there. It's used to slander real individuals without consequences as well and gullible people will believe anything they see on there. Fix this by banning AI generated slop on the site. This app has gone straight to the gutter.,0.10312500000000001,Positive

Spotify: Music and Podcasts,"disappointed by the fact that it will constantly randomly stop playing when I have full service. if I press play after it stops, then it will say it is playing, but not have any sound. also when you try to slip ads on a podcast from the pulldown, the app tweaks out. sad that this app keeps increasing in price, but doesn't fix these bugs.",-0.2,Negative

X,"I create an account and it gets suspended in a week and all I do is like posts and made one postivite comment.I'm a real person, I'm not violating and rules.I sent in an appeal and I have not heard back. Is this a way to punish users that do not pay the for the premium service?This is a good way to push people out from using this specific social media app.All I wanted to do was engage with the creators I follow on YouTube/Kick,keeping up art and news I'm glad I didn't pay for premium.Dumb AF 😭",0.23888888888888885,Positive
